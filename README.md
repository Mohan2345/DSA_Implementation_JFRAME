# DataStructure Odyssey: A Visual Journey Through Algorithms

## Project Description

DataStructure Odyssey is an interactive Java application that provides visual representations of fundamental data structures. This project aims to make learning about data structures more engaging and accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations of six core data structures:
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Circular Queues
  - Singly Linked Lists
  - Doubly Linked Lists
- Real-time operations on data structures
- User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing (JFrame)
- Educational tool for computer science students and enthusiasts

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (JFrame) for GUI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans)

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Locate the main class file (likely named `DataStructureOdyssey.java` or similar).
4. Run the main class to start the application.

## Usage

- Upon launching, you'll see the main interface with options for different data structures.
- Select a data structure to visualize.
- Use the provided buttons and input fields to perform operations on the selected data structure.
- Observe the real-time visual updates as you interact with the data structures.
